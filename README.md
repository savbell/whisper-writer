WhisperWriter is a versatile speech-to-text application that leverages multiple transcription backends, including [OpenAI's Whisper model](https://openai.com/research/whisper), [Faster Whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper/), and [VOSK](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/) to automatically transcribe audio from your microphone to the active window or other configurable outputs.

### Key Features

- **Multiple Profiles**: Configure and switch between different transcription setups on-the-fly.
- **Flexible Backends**: Support for local (Faster Whisper, VOSK) and API-based (OpenAI) transcription.
- **Customizable Shortcuts**: Each profile can have its own activation shortcut.
- **Various Recording Modes**: Choose from continuous, voice activity detection, press-to-toggle, or hold-to-record modes.
- **Post-Processing**: Apply customizable post-processing scripts to refine transcription output.
- **Multiple Output Methods**: Write to active window or implement new output handlers.
- **Streaming Support**: VOSK backend supports real-time transcription for immediate feedback.

### How It Works

WhisperWriter runs in the background, waiting for configured keyboard shortcuts. When a shortcut is pressed, the corresponding profile is activated, initiating the following process:

1. **Recording**: Audio is captured from the specified input device.
2. **Transcription**: The audio is processed by the configured backend.
3. **Post-Processing**: The transcribed text undergoes any specified post-processing steps.
4. **Output**: The final text is sent to the configured output method (e.g., typed into the active window).

A status window can optionally display the current stage of the process.

For more detailed information about the application's architecture and components, please refer to the [Design Document](DESIGN.md).

### Recording Modes

- **Continuous**: Records and transcribes continuously until the shortcut is pressed again.
- **Voice Activity Detection**: Stops recording after a pause in speech.
- **Press-to-Toggle**: Starts/stops recording with each shortcut press.
- **Hold-to-Record**: Records only while the shortcut is held down.

Refer to the [Configuration Options](#configuration-options) section for detailed settings.

WhisperWriter's modular design allows for easy extension with new backends, input methods, and output handlers to suit a wide range of use cases.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you can run this app, you'll need to have the following software installed:

- Git: [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Python `3.11`: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

If you want to run `faster-whisper` on your GPU, you'll also need to install the following NVIDIA libraries:

- [cuBLAS for CUDA 12](https://developer.nvidia.com/cublas)
- [cuDNN 8 for CUDA 12](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn)

<details>
<summary>More information on GPU execution</summary>

The below was taken directly from the [`faster-whisper` README](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper?tab=readme-ov-file#gpu):

**Note:** The latest versions of `ctranslate2` support CUDA 12 only. For CUDA 11, the current workaround is downgrading to the `3.24.0` version of `ctranslate2` (This can be done with `pip install --force-reinsall ctranslate2==3.24.0`).

There are multiple ways to install the NVIDIA libraries mentioned above. The recommended way is described in the official NVIDIA documentation, but we also suggest other installation methods below.

#### Use Docker

The libraries (cuBLAS, cuDNN) are installed in these official NVIDIA CUDA Docker images: `nvidia/cuda:12.0.0-runtime-ubuntu20.04` or `nvidia/cuda:12.0.0-runtime-ubuntu22.04`.

#### Install with `pip` (Linux only)

On Linux these libraries can be installed with `pip`. Note that `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` must be set before launching Python.

```bash
pip install nvidia-cublas-cu12 nvidia-cudnn-cu12

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`python3 -c 'import os; import nvidia.cublas.lib; import nvidia.cudnn.lib; print(os.path.dirname(nvidia.cublas.lib.__file__) + ":" + os.path.dirname(nvidia.cudnn.lib.__file__))'`
```

**Note**: Version 9+ of `nvidia-cudnn-cu12` appears to cause issues due its reliance on cuDNN 9 (Faster-Whisper does not currently support cuDNN 9). Ensure your version of the Python package is for cuDNN 8.

#### Download the libraries from Purfview's repository (Windows & Linux)

Purfview's [whisper-standalone-win](https://github.com/Purfview/whisper-standalone-win) provides the required NVIDIA libraries for Windows & Linux in a [single archive](https://github.com/Purfview/whisper-standalone-win/releases/tag/libs). Decompress the archive and place the libraries in a directory included in the `PATH`.

### Installation
To set up and run the project, follow these steps:

#### 1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/savbell/whisper-writer
cd whisper-writer
```

#### 2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```
python -m venv venv

# For Linux and macOS:
source venv/bin/activate

# For Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### 3. Install the required packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 4. Run the Python code:

```
python run.py
```

#### 5. Configure and start WhisperWriter:
On first run, a Settings window should appear. Once configured and saved, another window will open. Press "Start" to activate the keyboard listener. Press the activation key (`ctrl+shift+space` by default) to start recording and transcribing to the active window.

### Configuration Options

WhisperWriter uses a configuration file to customize its behaviour. To set up the configuration, open the Settings window:

## Known Issues

### 1. Shortcut Interference with Output

**Issue:** Shortcuts can interfere with the application's output, potentially causing unintended effects in the target application.

**Examples:**
- Holding "Shift" during output results in capitalized text.
- Holding "Ctrl" while the app types "v" may trigger a paste command in the target application.

**Workarounds:**
a) Use Continuous or Voice Activity Detection (VAD) modes to minimize shortcut holding during typing.
b) Choose shortcuts carefully, especially for "Press to Toggle" or "Hold to Record" modes.
c) Test shortcuts by holding them down while typing to check for conflicts.
d) Consider using mouse buttons (e.g., mouse_forward, mouse_back) for "Hold to Record" mode.

**Technical Explanation:** Current typing simulation methods create virtual keyboards, which are indistinguishable from physical keyboards at the display server level. This makes it impossible for user applications to differentiate between virtual and physical keyboard inputs.

**Potential Future Solution:** Developing an Input Method module for ibus or fcitx could overcome this limitation, as these frameworks operate above the display server level.

### 2. Status Window Focus Issues on Wayland

**Issue:** The status window grabs focus and interferes with output when using the Wayland display server.

**Workaround:** Consider disabling the status window by turning off the "Show status window" option in the settings.

### General Recommendations

1. Carefully select and test shortcuts to minimize conflicts with your typical workflow and applications.
2. Be aware of the limitations when using "Press to Toggle" or "Hold to Record" modes, especially with streaming transcription.
3. On Wayland systems, consider operating without the status window for smoother performance.
